      <h1>Hatha Yoga</h1>
      <p>
        In this class, postures are practiced to align, strengthen and promote
        flexibility in the body. Breathing techniques and meditation are also
        integrated. You can expect an emphasis on simplicity, repetition, and
        ease of movement. Full-body relaxation and balance are the goals, as we
        make a full circuit of the body’s range of motion with standing
        postures, twists, backbends, forward folds, and hip openers.
      </p>
      <h1>Vinyasa and Hatha Flow</h1>
      <p>
        Vinyasa ( translates to “flowing with breath”) is a dynamic style of
        Hatha yoga which joins physical postures, or asanas, with inhales and
        exhales, creating a steady internal rhythm for the practice. Our Flow
        classes are designed to cultivate heat in the body with creative
        sequences involving sun salutations, standing and seated postures, back
        bending, arm balancing, and a strong focus on the power of breath
        awareness. Flow yoga classes tend to be more vigorous and aerobic, and
        classes can have a variety of music and themes.
      </p>
      <h1>Slow Flow and Restore</h1>
      <p>
        This class will flow slowly through sun salutations and postures
        designed to build internal heat slowly and gently. Meditation and
        Pranaymana (breath work) techniques are taught to promote relaxation.
        Class concludes with Restorative Yoga postures which settle the body and
        mind.
      </p>
      <h1>Hatha Flow</h1>
      <p>
        A gentle class focusing on flowing from pose to pose and linking the
        movement with the breath. The instructor will offer a variety of
        modifications to encourage participation of everyone. We do sitting,
        standing, and inverted postures, and suggest challenging variations for
        more advanced students, yet fun and non-intimidating options for newer
        students. All levels- BEGINNERS WELCOME!
      </p>
      <h1>Yin Yoga</h1>
      <p>
        Enjoy the feelings of rejuvenation and steadiness that arise from a Yin
        Yoga practice as you slow down, move from noise to silence, from
        agitation to calm, from complexity to simplicity. This practice
        integrates the ancient Yoga teachings with Meridian Theory as taught in
        Chinese Medicine. Engage the body’s natural healing power as you
        actively nourish and harmonize the body's vital life force or chi. As
        the whole body rests and opens with long held poses, the natural healing
        power of chi is used to rejuvenate and repair the area of focus.
