                In this class, postures are practiced to align, strengthen and
                promote flexibility in the body. Breathing techniques and
                meditation are also integrated. You can expect an emphasis on
                simplicity, repetition, and ease of movement. Full-body
                relaxation and balance are the goals, as we make a full circuit
                of the body’s range of motion with standing postures, twists,
                backbends, forward folds, and hip openers.
